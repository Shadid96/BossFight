# BossFight
WIP boss fight code created as Python practice. Probably more fun to make than to play.
I've mostly tested it with character levels between 40 and 60. Please let me know if you find any issues.
This is a beginner's project so there may be some bad coding practices that I'll work on not making a habit.
